Demoscene "demo" at http://graffathon.fi/ 2015

Mostly about colorful cubes in a grayscale world.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve camera "flights"
- [ ] Fix the commented-out section that could optionally recurse cubes into smaller cubes into... until a limit is met
- [ ] Add new, completely separate effect scenes

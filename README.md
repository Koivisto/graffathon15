Demoscene "demo" at http://graffathon.fi/ 2015

Mostly about colorful cubes in a grayscale world.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the currently last camera "flight" around and through the big cube
- [ ] Refactor discoCube() into cube() or smallCube() depending on availability of name
- [X] Fix the commented-out section that could optionally recurse cubes into smaller cubes into... until a limit is met
- [X] Add creator mentions
- [ ] Add new, completely separate effect scenes
- [ ] Smooth out recursive big cube coloring / spacing / rotation (?)
- [ ] Shaders? Shaders!
- [ ] IF there's time, create some music :)

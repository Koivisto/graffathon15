Demoscene "demo" at http://graffathon.fi/ 2015

Mostly about colorful cubes in a grayscale world.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the currently last camera "flight" around and through the big cube
- [X] Fix the commented-out section that could optionally recurse cubes into smaller cubes into... until a limit is met
- [ ] Add new, completely separate effect scenes
- [ ] Shaders? Shaders!
- [ ] IF there's time, create some music :)
